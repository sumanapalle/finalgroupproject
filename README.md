# Changing Patterns of Flooding in Miami: 30 Years of Trends Across Flood Types

## Summary:
We explore how sea level rise, high tide flooding, precipitation, and hurricanes have changed in Miami over the past 30 years. We will analyze the patterns of sea level rise, as well as the frequency of each flood type, to understand if flood risks are shifting.

Our hypothesis is as follows:
- Sea level in the Miami area has risen in the last 30 years
- The severity of high tide flooding, precipitation, and hurricanes has increased
- The frequency of hurricanes has increased

We will then superimpose our flood analysis with maps of Miami to understand risk by neighborhood.
